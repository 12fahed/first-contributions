# First Contributions

| <img alt="Fork" src="https://git-fork.com/images/logo.png" width="200"> | Fork Edition |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. But open source is all about collaboration & working together. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what comes better than actually doing the stuff without messing up anything. This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way rookies make their first contribution. Remember the more relaxed you are, the better you learn. If you are looking for making your first contribution just follow the simple steps below. We promise you, it will be fun.

## Fork (Git Client)

Download [Fork](https://git-fork.com/), install and open it.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-welcome.png" alt="Fork welcome screen" />

You should see the Fork welcome screen. If this is your first time using Fork, you'll need to configure your Git credentials. Go to Fork → Preferences (on macOS) or File → Settings (on Windows/Linux).

In the Git tab, enter your name and email address. These will be used for your commits.

If you want to authenticate with GitHub, go to the Accounts tab and add your GitHub account. This will make it easier to clone and work with your repositories.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

## Fork this repository

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top right of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone this repo to your machine using Fork.

In Fork, you can clone a repository in several ways:
1. **File → Clone**: Click on File menu, then Clone
2. **Welcome screen**: Click "Clone repository" on the welcome screen
3. **Keyboard shortcut**: Use Cmd+Shift+O (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows/Linux)

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

In the clone dialog:
1. Paste your forked repository URL (from your GitHub account, not the original)
2. Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the repository
3. Click "Clone"

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you're cloning YOUR fork of the repository, not the original repository. Check that the URL contains your GitHub username.

After cloning, Fork will automatically open the repository and you'll see the project files in the sidebar.

## Create a branch

Now create a branch using Fork's interface.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-branch.png" alt="create a branch" />

1. In the left sidebar, right-click on the "main" branch (or "master" depending on the repository)
2. Select "New Branch..."
3. Name your branch "add-your-name", for example: "add-john-doe"
4. Make sure "Checkout new branch" is checked
5. Click "Create Branch"

You'll now see that you're working on your new branch - this is displayed in the toolbar and in the branches list.

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open the `Contributors.md` file in your favorite text editor and add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-status.png" alt="Check status" />

If you go to Fork, you'll see there are changes. These changes have been added to your working directory.

To see the changes, click on the "Changes" tab in Fork. You'll see the files that have been modified.

Review the changes to make sure everything looks correct. You should see your name added to the Contributors.md file.

To commit these changes:

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-commit.png" alt="commit your changes" />

1. Select the modified file(s) in the "Changes" section
2. Click "Stage" to stage the files (or drag them to the "Staged" section)
3. Write a commit message in the text box at the bottom, e.g., "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
4. Click "Commit"

Once committed, you'll see your commit in the history view.

## Push changes to GitHub

Now you need to push your changes to your GitHub repository.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-push.png" alt="push your changes" />

In Fork:
1. Click the "Push" button in the toolbar (or use Cmd+P on macOS / Ctrl+P on Windows)
2. In the push dialog, make sure you're pushing to the correct remote (origin) and branch
3. Click "Push"

Fork will upload your changes to your GitHub repository. You can verify this by going to your repository on GitHub - you should see your new branch and changes there.

## Submit your changes for review

Now you need to create a pull request to submit your changes for review.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/gui-tool-tutorials/fork-tutorial/fork-pr.png" alt="create pull request" />

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. You'll likely see a banner saying "Your recently pushed branches" with a "Compare & pull request" button - click it
3. Alternatively, click "Pull requests" tab and then "New pull request"
4. Make sure the base repository is `firstcontributions/first-contributions` and the base branch is `main`
5. Make sure the head repository is your fork and the compare branch is your new branch
6. Add a title and description for your pull request
7. Click "Create pull request"

Congratulations! You've just submitted your first contribution to open source!
